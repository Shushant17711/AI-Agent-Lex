# Multi-Agent System

A sophisticated multi-agent system implementation that enables autonomous agents to collaborate, communicate, and solve complex tasks collectively.

## 🌟 Overview

This multi-agent system is designed to create a distributed problem-solving environment where multiple AI agents can work together seamentially. It supports dynamic agent interactions, task allocation, and coordinated decision-making processes.

## ✨ Features

- **Autonomous Agents**: Multiple independent agents capable of making decisions
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Robust messaging system for agent interactions
- **Task Distribution**: Dynamic task allocation and load balancing
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new agents and functionalities
- **Real-time Coordination**: Synchronized agent activities and resource management
- **Fault Tolerance**: System resilience through agent redundancy

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (install via pip):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shushant17711/AI-Agent-Lex.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AI-Agent-Lex
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 💡 Usage

1. Initialize the agent system:
   ```python
   from multi_agent import AgentSystem
   
   system = AgentSystem()
   ```

2. Create and deploy agents:
   ```python
   # Create specific agents
   agent1 = system.create_agent('TaskManager')
   agent2 = system.create_agent('ResourceHandler')
   
   # Start the system
   system.start()
   ```

## 🎯 Examples

```python
# Example of agent communication
agent1.send_message(agent2, {
    'type': 'task_request',
    'content': 'Process data batch'
})

# Example of task execution
agent2.execute_task({
    'task_type': 'data_processing',
    'parameters': {'batch_size': 100}
})
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Agents can be configured through the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
agent_settings:
  communication_protocol: 'TCP'
  max_agents: 10
  timeout: 30
```
